### Get the extension

> _insert chrome webstore link_

If you're interested in modifying more aspects of the scene, see the [docs](https://github.com/dx81/chrome-animated-3dBg/docs/internals.md).

### Using the extension

_insert screenshot of settings @ publication date here_

The extension is controlled completely by the settings menu (except [internal aspects](https://github.com/dx81/chrome-animated-3dBg/docs/internals.md)), 
which allows you to choose from different presents or to define completely custom scenes, and even custom polygons.

As seen above, the settings menu has a few different functionalities:  

- Uploading a new JSON file to render. This will overwrite the current scene, and stay until something is changed manually. See the documentation for the JSON [here](https://github.com/dx81/chrome-animated-3dBg/docs/json.md)
- Downloading the currently used JSON data. Either pre-made scenes or your own data will be returned to you in a JSON file as a download.
- Clearing the currently loaded JSON. This will reset the scene to the default cube.
- Show debug information. Enabling this will show FPS rates and other info in the top right corner.
- Presets. This feature allows you to load a pre-made preset that was made by us, the developers. Note though, it will overwrite your own JSON if any is present.
